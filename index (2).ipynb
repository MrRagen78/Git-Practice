Joins are the primary mechanism for combining data from multiple tables. In order to do this, you define the common attribute(s) between tables in order for them to be combined.\n","\n","## Objectives  \n","\n","You will be able to:  \n"," \n","* Write SQL queries that make use of various types of joins\n","* Compare and contrast the various types of joins\n","* Discuss how primary and foreign keys are used in SQL\n","* Decide and perform whichever type of join is best for retrieving desired data\n","\n","\n","## CRM ERD\n","\n","In almost all industry cases, rather than just working with a single table you will generally need data from multiple tables. Doing this requires the use of **joins** using shared columns from the two tables.

also assign tables an **alias** by entering an alternative shorthand name. This is slightly different than the previous lesson where we introduced aliases for column names, since now we are aliasing *tables*.\n","\n","When aliasing columns the goal is usually to improve readability by giving something a more specific or easier-to-read name. For example, `name AS employee_name`, `AVG(AVG) AS average_batting_average`, or `COUNT(*) AS num_products`.\n","\n","When aliasing tables the goal is usually to shorten the name, in order to shorten the overall query. So typically you'll see examples that alias a longer table name to a one-character or two-character shorthand. For example, `orderdetails AS od` or `products AS p`. (It is also possible to use aliases to clarify what exactly is in a table, like how aliases are used for columns, just less common.)\n","\n","The following query produces the same result as the previous ones, using aliases `od` and `p` for `orderdetails` and `products`, respectively:\n","\n","> In the following cell, type the following code to demonstrate the use of
